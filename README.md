# Data_analysis_project1
### My first Data Analyis project with python and jupyter notebooks
This is my work regarding COVID-19 pandemic. The two notebooks were developed with the help of <b> The Codex.me </b>, which is an online platform for learning how to code through high quality programming courses.
The first notebook is an introduction to worldwide data for COVID-19, concerning total deaths, confirmed or recovered cases and a general view of some multitudinous countries (USA, UK and India) and my homeland Greece.
Moreover the data was emanated from an upstream repository maintained by the team at Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE). For more informations please visit https://github.com/datasets/covid-19
