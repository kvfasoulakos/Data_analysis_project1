# Data_analysis_project1
### My first Data Analyis project with python and jupyter notebooks
This is my work regarding COVID-19 pandemic. The two notebooks were developed with the help of <b> The Codex.me </b>, which is an online platform for learning how to code through high quality programming courses.
The first notebook is an introduction to worldwide data for COVID-19, concerning total deaths, confirmed or recovered cases and a general view of some multitudinous countries (USA, UK and India) and my homeland Greece.
